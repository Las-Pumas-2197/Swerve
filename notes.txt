Swerve v5.2

Added minimums and tolerances with conditionals to PID outputs (azimuth + heading).
Off-boarded telemetry to it's own class.
Correctly calculated constraints for motion profiles and velocity limits.

Swerve v5.3

Added feedforwards for drive velocity and turn.
Added some calculated feedforward gains. Gains need properly calculated.
Pushing module azimuth off of mainly PID control, moving toward mostly FF control with PID for trim.
Adjusted telemetry in swervemain class to limit information that is posted to shuffleboard.
Rewrote HIDs class to be less verbose and to pass directly to the swervemain class.
Need to calculate FF gains.
Delays in absolute encoder readings may be contributing some hysteresis.
Implementation of FFs may help by reducing dependence on feedback controller (PIDs), and increase system performance.
Moving PID and FF calculation to spark maxes may be neccesary in v6 to improve performance.

Constants that need measured:
turnFFkS, module azimuth kS
turnFFkV, module azumuth kV
turnFFkA, module azimuth kA
driveFFkS, module drive kS
driveFFkV, module drive kV
driveFFkA, module drive kA
headingFFkS, heading kS
headingFFkV, heading kV
headingFFkA, heading kA
modulemaxvelmps, max acheivable linear velocity of module
modulemaxaclmps, max acheivable linear acceleration of module
modulemaxvelrads, max acheivable rotational velocity of module
modulemaxaclrads, max acheivable rotational acceleration of module
headingmaxvelrads, max acheivable rotational velocity of entire robot
headingmaxaclrads, max acheivable rotational accleration of entire robot

possibly develop swerveID to assist with calculating values?
