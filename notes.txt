Swerve v5.2

Added minimums and tolerances with conditionals to PID outputs (azimuth + heading).
Off-boarded telemetry to it's own class.
Correctly calculated constraints for motion profiles and velocity limits.

Swerve v5.3

Added feedforwards for drive velocity and turn.
Added some calculated feedforward gains. Gains need properly calculated.
Pushing module azimuth off of mainly PID control, moving toward mostly FF control with PID for trim.
Adjusted telemetry in swervemain class to limit information that is posted to shuffleboard.
Rewrote HIDs class to be less verbose and to pass directly to the swervemain class.
Need to calculate FF gains.

Constants that need measured:
turnFFkS, module azimuth kS
turnFFkV, module azumuth kV
turnFFkA, module azimuth kA
driveFFkS, module drive kS
driveFFkV, module drive kV
driveFFkA, module drive kA
headingFFkS, heading kS
headingFFkV, heading kV
headingFFkA, heading kA
